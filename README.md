# juzi2

Backend of my quote wall app

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.
You will need Erlang version R15B01 or above installed.  On a Mac I recommend homebrew to install it (brew install erlang)

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    ./go

## TODO

* Force https (x-forwarded protto and all that.  Look at lib-noir on how they did that)
* Create nicer 500 and 404 pages
